			purpose = <" Identifies low-risk women who can safely discontinue VTE treatment.">
			use = <"Indefinite anticoagulation is burdensome and associated with bleeding risk. The HERDOO2 Rule can identify patients who have very low risk of recurrent VTE and can therefore safely stop anticoagulation in the short term.

When to Use:
Women ≥18 years old with unprovoked VTE. Inclusion criteria in the original study:

Patients diagnosed 5–7 months before enrollment.
On heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for ≥5 days and oral anticoagulation for 5–7 months after the event.
Without recurrent VTE during the treatment period.
Noncompressible segment on compression ultrasound of popliteal (or more proximal) leg vein, high-probability V/Q scan, or segmental (or larger) artery filling defect on spiral CT.
Exclusion criteria:

Leg fracture.
Lower-extremity plaster cast.
Immobilization for >3 days.
General anesthetic <3 months before index event.
Cancer diagnosis within 5 years.
