			use = <"The HERDOO2 Rule can identify patients who have very low risk of recurrent VTE and can therefore safely stop anticoagulation in the short term.

When to Use:
Women ≥18 years old with unprovoked VTE. Inclusion criteria in the original study:

Patients diagnosed 5–7 months before enrollment.
On heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for ≥5 days and oral anticoagulation for 5–7 months after the event.
Without recurrent VTE during the treatment period.
Noncompressible segment on compression ultrasound of popliteal (or more proximal) leg vein, high-probability V/Q scan, or segmental (or larger) artery filling defect on spiral CT.
Exclusion criteria:

Leg fracture.
Lower-extremity plaster cast.
Immobilization for >3 days.
General anesthetic <3 months before index event.
Cancer diagnosis within 5 years.
