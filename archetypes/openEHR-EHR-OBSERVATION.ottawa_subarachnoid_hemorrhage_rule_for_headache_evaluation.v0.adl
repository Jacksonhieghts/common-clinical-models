			purpose = <"Rules out SAH in patients with headache.">
			use = <"Patients with headache who are neurologically intact.


Why Use:
Ruling out SAH is challenging in patients presenting with headache but no neurologic deficits.
SAH is rare and accounts for only ~1% of ED patients presenting with headache (Vermeulen 1990), and missed diagnoses have potentially devastating results.
Conversely, a tool that reliably rules out SAH is useful to avoid unnecessary workup (more tests do not always clarify the diagnosis).
Lumbar puncture (LP) is often performed as the confirmatory test if noncontrast CT is negative but clinical suspicion still high. LP is painful and carries risk of bleeding and headache worse than the original presenting headache.">
			misuse = <"Only apply in: Alert patients ≥15 years old, new severe atraumatic headache, maximum intensity within 1 hour.

Do not use in: Patients with new neurologic deficits, prior aneurysm, prior SAH, known brain tumors, or chronic recurrent headaches (≥3 headaches of the same character and intensity for >6 months).



The Ottawa SAH Rule was developed for use in an emergency department setting in patients presenting with acute headache.
The rule is 100% sensitive for SAH (i.e., a rule-out tool).
Should only be used in patients who are alert and oriented, presenting within 14 days of headache, without history of head trauma or fall in the past 7 days.
It can NOT be used in patients with new neurologic deficits, previous history of headache syndrome, or intracranial lesions (see Evidence for full exclusion criteria).
Specificity is low (15%), and so it should not be used to diagnose SAH, even in patients in whom all criteria are positive. As with other rule-out decision aids, just because a patient fails the rule does not require that all patients are then evaluated for SAH, given its very low specificity.">
