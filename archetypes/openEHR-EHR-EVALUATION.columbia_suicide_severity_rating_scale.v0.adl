Suicide risk assessment is complex, and the C-SSRS can assist clinicians with their evalulation of patients in the ER to predict their overall risk and need for admission.

Extensively validated in various patient populations, including children as young as five years old and adolescents.

Recommended and adopted by the US Food and Drug Administration for clinical trials (FDA 2012) and Centers for Disease Control to define and stratify suicidal ideation and behavior (Crosby 2011).">

Best validated in emergency settings (i.e., to triage patients in the emergency department) and also has limited validation in the outpatient psychiatry setting (Viguera 2015).">
