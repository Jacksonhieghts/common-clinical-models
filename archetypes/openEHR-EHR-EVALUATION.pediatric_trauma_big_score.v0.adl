			purpose = <"The Pediatric Trauma BIG Score was developed by Borgman et al in 2011 to rapidly assess the severity of illness and predict mortality in pediatric trauma patients. Stratifies severity of illness and predicts mortality in pediatric patients after trauma.">

BIG is an acronym for the components of the score: base deficit, INR, and GCS.

Three variables, the base deficit, international normalized ratio (INR), and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) were found to be independently predictive of mortality. A model score was then derived using data from 707 pediatric patients and evaluated for mortality by using a receiver-operating curve (ROC) analysis. In the guidleine the three variables are used to predict mortality by using the formula: Pediatric BIG Score = (base deficit) + (2.5 Ã— INR) + (15 - GCS). The resultant score is output as a percentage.

Note: Pediatric BIG Score of 26 (i.e., base deficit 10, INR 3.6, GCS 8) predicts a mortality of 50% with a positive predictive value of 65%, negative predictive value of 93%, and specificity of 99% (Borgman 2011).

The GCS scre is:
Simple, rapid, and accurate scoring system to evaluate the severity of illness and predict mortality in children.

Can be applied to both blunt and penetrating traumatic injuries.

Useful in quantifying degree of physiological derangement beyond clinical appearance and GCS alone. Base deficit and INR are physiologic measures of hypoperfusion and trauma-induced coagulopathy, respectively, and both play critical roles in trauma-related mortality.
