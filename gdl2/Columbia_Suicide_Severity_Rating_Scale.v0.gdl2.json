        "misuse": "Often based entirely on patient-reported items, but also allows for integration of information from other sources (e.g. family and friends, healthcare professionals, hospital records, coroner’s report/death certificate).\n\nBest validated in emergency settings (i.e., to triage patients in the emergency department) and also has limited validation in the outpatient psychiatry setting (Viguera 2015).",
