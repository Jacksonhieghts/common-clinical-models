        "use": "Use in adult patients with suspected inhalation injury undergoing flexible bronchoscopy.\n\nWhy Use:\n\nNo universal consensus exists on grading for inhalation injury. The AIS has been widely utilized as the predominant bronchoscopic inhalation injury severity score in the literature (but have not been compared head to head with other bronchoscopic criteria).\nOf note, a multicenter prospective cohort study by the American Burn Association is currently underway to develop and validate a scoring system for inhalation injury based on clinical, radiographic, bronchoscopic, and biochemical parameters.",
        "misuse": "Pitfalls:\n\nMay predict development of ARDS, length of time on mechanical ventilation, and prolonged ICU stay.\nSome studies have found a non-statistically significant trend towards worse outcomes with higher AIS.\nAIS severity has not been consistently associated with mortality (Sheridan 2016).\nCannot reliably predict need for high fluid resuscitation requirements.\nA typical flexible bronchoscope is on average 5 mm in diameter. Hence, bronchoscopy can only identify proximal airway changes and not the narrower distal and peripheral airway changes. Thus, bronchoscopic findings cannot be fully relied upon to accurately reflect the overall severity of airway inhalation injury.\n\n",
